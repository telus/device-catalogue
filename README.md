### Hurdle

The image import fails jest unit testing test case for routing, tried to solve it with some additional jest config and mock files but it still fails the test. Need to investigate further. While it was frustrating that it didn't work, jest was very useful when it comes to making sure all the required prop types are included in the components.

# Device Catalogue

A customer would like to browse all the Apple devices available for purchase. Create an application with a component that reads and displays devices from the local restful API on port `8081`.
The API has two routes `/watches` which returns a list of watches and `/iphones` which returns a list of iPhones.

## Application Requirements

* Create a `/watches` route that displays a grid of watch device cards - reference [card design](#reference-device-card)
* Create a `/iphones` route that displays a grid of iPhone device cards - reference [card design](#reference-device-card)
* Each route represents a page in the application. Each page should have a heading indicating the type of device listed on the page and a grid showing all the devices in that category.
* An index page with a list of all pages (i.e. A watch page and phone page).
* Unit tests for your work where it makes sense. At Telus Digital we pride ourselves on having applications with great test coverage. Please be prepared to talk about your testing choices.
* [TDS](https://tds.telus.com/components/index.html) components **MUST** be used. List of useful [components](#useful-tds-components).

Apple Watch and iPhone assets are available in the [public directory](/public/images)

## Submission Requirements

* Fork this repository to your personal Github account
* Submit your solution as a Pull Request against the main branch of your forked repository

## The anatomy of the device API response

The mock API replies with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "Apple Watch Series 6",
      "brand": "Apple",
      "price": 1399
    }
  ]
}
```

## Local development

Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Start the local API server on port 8081 along with a client side user interface on port 8080.

```sh
npm run dev
```

Running the tests

```sh
npm run unit
```

## Reference Device Card

All device cards should look as close as possible to the following device card:

Note: all device cards should simply showcase the name of the device, the brand and price with the following copy:

# Blockers
Was using Jest to perfom Unit testing while testing the routes ran into image import issue
When I import image files, Jest tries to interpret the binary codes of the images as .js, hence runs into errors.
The only way out is to mock a default response anytime jest sees an image import
So in the config setting added moduleNameMapper under jest config
This should mock the image wherever the import happens, but still running into error might need little more time to resolve

# Device Catalogue

A customer would like to browse all the Apple devices available for purchase. Create an application with a component that reads and displays devices from the local restful API on port `8081`.
The API has two routes `/watches` which returns a list of watches and `/iphones` which returns a list of iPhones.

## Application Requirements

* Create a `/watches` route that displays a grid of watch Item cards - reference [card design](#reference-device-card)
* Create a `/iphones` route that displays a grid of iPhone Item cards - reference [card design](#reference-device-card)
* Each route represents a page in the application. Each page should have a heading indicating the type of device listed on the page and a grid showing all the devices in that category.
* An index page with a list of all pages (i.e. A watch page and phone page).
* Unit tests for your work where it makes sense. At Telus Digital we pride ourselves on having applications with great test coverage. Please be prepared to talk about your testing choices.
* [TDS](https://tds.telus.com/components/index.html) components **MUST** be used. List of useful [components](#useful-tds-components).

Apple Watch and iPhone assets are available in the [public directory](/public/images)

## Submission Requirements

* Fork this repository to your personal Github account
* Submit your solution as a Pull Request against the main branch of your forked repository

## The anatomy of the device API response

The mock API replies with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "Apple Watch Series 6",
      "brand": "Apple",
      "price": 1399
    }
  ]
}
```

## Local development

Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Start the local API server on port 8081 along with a client side user interface on port 8080.

```sh
npm run dev
```

Running the tests

```sh
npm run unit
```

## Reference Item card

All Item cards should look as close as possible to the following Item card:

Note: all Item cards should simply showcase the name of the device, the brand and price with the following copy:

## Reference Item grid

The Item grid should look as close as possible to the following Item grid but exact spacing isn't required:
